SA-Tabu is a surrogate-assisted algorithm for solving the large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. In this study, we experiment with Large-scale Storage Location Assignment Problems with Grouping Constrains.  

The detailed description and the guideline for reproducing the results please refer to <a href="/SA_Tabu_EN.pdf">[pdf]</a>.
